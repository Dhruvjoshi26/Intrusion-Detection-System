Intrusion Detection System ‚Äì App Detect Template
This project is a basic template for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using image recognition. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a simple frontend-based IDS UI where real-time image/video can be displayed and alerts can be simulated using a template structure.

üîç Project Overview
The app includes:

A simple HTML interface (index.html)

A basic detection simulation or visual effect using JavaScript (script.js) or CSS (style.css)

Layout for future backend integration (e.g., camera feed, alert system)

This template serves as a frontend demo of an image recognition-based intrusion detection system.

üìÇ File Structure
File	Description
index.html	Main HTML file that contains the UI and layout
script.js	JavaScript file that adds interactivity or detection logic
style.css	(Optional) CSS file that styles the page
README.md	Project documentation (this file)

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Clone or download the repository.

Open index.html in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

The page will simulate a layout for intrusion detection.

If script.js is included, open browser developer console (F12) to see logs or alerts.

üì∏ Features
Responsive and minimal UI.

Simulation-ready interface.

Easily extendable to connect with camera feeds or detection models using Python backend.

üß± Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

üß† Future Enhancements
Integrate with Python-based backend for real-time intrusion detection using OpenCV or deep learning.

Add audio or popup alerts for detection.

Record detection logs.
